\section{Highlights}
\rule[3pt]{\textwidth}{0.4pt}

\section{\sc Nested ESXi}
To be able to have ESXi servers on demand primarily for development, I manage
to boot ESXi on QEMU. To do, and be able to take advantage of nested
virtualization features, I had to dig into QEMU and Linux kernel code, and
cherry-pick couple of commits to our production environment and only then we
could have Hardware CPU and MMU support for our nested VMs.

\section{\sc Windows BSOD on AWS}
Arrikto software supports instand backup and launching of VMs. Our customers
wanted to backup VMs running on on-prem, e.g., on ESXi, and then launch them to
AWS running Xen. Booting Linux VMs was pretty easy. Booting Windows resulted to
BSOD. And on AWS if it doen't boot all you have is a screenshot. Nothing else.
In a nutshel, I had to simulate AWS EC2 environment locally, Xen Hypervisor,
proper PVHVM setup, patch iPXE software, inspect XenStore, use Windows kernel
debugger, patch official XenServer xenvif driver, install this drivers and
tweak windows registry offline using WinPE and finally watch it boot.

\section{\sc Poor QoS on internal DNS}
At some point we experienced poor QoS on our internal setup. I had to tcpdump
our routers and find out that there was a DNS loop that was exhausting the
internal queues of our DNS server (dnsmasq) and thus the latency of random
DNS replies we dramatically high.

\section{\sc Ping packet loss}
At some point we experienced packet loss on our internal network, i.e., 5\% for
ping. This made the Ceph OSD daemons running on this host a bottleneck. We had
a bond with two slave that we not properly configured on the switch. Still, we
probably bumped into a kernel bug since, after using tcpdump on all involved
interfaces, I noticed that the host was getting all packets but it was sending
every now and then replies via the "wrong" slave. So LACP (802.3ad) was
practically not working. Removing the one slave from the bond made Ceph
operational again.

\section{\sc Router dropping packets}
We observed times when DNS would not respond, but retrying very soon after
would generally work. I noticed that the kernel logs on the router were
saying "kernel: nf\_conntrack: table full, dropping packet". Indeed
/proc/net/nf\_conntrack was full. So I used NOTRACK for DNS replies and the
problem was solved.
