\section{Highlights}
\rule[3pt]{\textwidth}{0.4pt}

\section{Arrikto}

\section{\sc On-prem support}
Add support for deploying our software on-prem, including air-gapped
environments.

\section{\sc KServe performance tuning}
Do a performance analysis on KServe inference services, manage to find the
bottlenecks of vanilla setup and suggest tweaks for Istio and KNative to
improve request throughput and latency.

\section{\sc Scale}
Work on supporting deploying the software at scale, i.e., on Kubernetes
clusters with hundreds of nodes.

\section{\sc Cloud Integration}
Integrate and deploy our software on various Cloud Platforms (AWS, CGP, and
Azure) and also on premises (NVIDIA Bright).

\section{\sc MiniKF}
Design and implementation of a stripped down version of our software as a
pre-packaged VM on AWS, GCP, and Vagrant.

\section{\sc Software containerization}
Design and implementation of the containerization of our software
that used to be appliance-based.

\section{\sc Release management}
Design the build system of the software, how to version, package and distribute
it in the context of every commit is a release while emphasizing on a GitOps
process for deploying it.

\section{\sc Customer\\support}
Be on-call and deal with Sev1 customer issues in real time, debug systems at
scale, troubleshoot, and be able to identify even customer-side
misconfiguration on Cloud platforms or on-prem.

\section{\sc Full stack awareness}
Know the whole stack of the software, know how all components integrate with
each other, and as such be able to identify and troubleshoot pretty much any
issue.

\section{\sc Bug hunting}
Insist on finding the root cause of an issue, be able to reproduce it, and
finally identify where the bug is and what need to be done for solving it.


\section{GRNET}

\section{\sc Device Hotplug in Ganeti}
In older version of Google Ganeti, one had to reboot a VM in order to
add/remove devices NICs/Disks. Managed to submit and merge upstream a PR
supporting device hotplug for VMs running with the KVM hypervisor.

\section{\sc L2 isolated Network in Synnefo}
In synnefo, to be able to have private networks per user at first place we
had to rely on physical VLANs. But this had a limit of approximately 1000
private network. I had designed a software implementation based on unique MAC
prefixes and ebtables rules.

\section{Air Force}

\section{\sc Booking management platform}
During military service, I designed and implemented a booking management
platform from scratch for a resort of National Air Force. They have been using
it since then, which translates to more than 10 years up-and-running.

\section{Misc}

\section{\sc BSOD on AWS}
Our customers wanted to backup VMs running on on-prem, e.g., on ESXi, and then
be able to launch them on AWS. Booting Linux VMs was pretty easy. Booting
Windows resulted to BSOD. And on AWS if it doesn't boot all you have is a
screenshot. Nothing else. In a nutshel, I had to simulate AWS EC2 environment
locally, Xen Hypervisor, proper PVHVM setup, patch iPXE software, inspect
XenStore, use Windows kernel debugger, patch official XenServer xenvif driver,
install this drivers and tweak windows registry offline using WinPE and
finally watch it boot.

\section{\sc Packaging for Windows}
Managed to have CMake running on Linux generate a setup.exe for Windows using
PyInstaller, Wine and WiX toolset. This has been proved to be really helpful for
out CI/CD since on each commit we had the corresponding Windows installer.

\section{\sc Nested ESXi}
To be able to have ESXi servers on demand, primarily for development, I manage
to boot ESXi on QEMU. To do, and be able to take advantage of nested
virtualization features, I had to dig into QEMU and Linux kernel code, and
cherry-pick couple of commits to our production environment and only then we
could have Hardware CPU and MMU support for our nested VMs.
